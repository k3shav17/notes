- pop() is used to remove last element of an array
- shift() is used to  remove first element of an array

The scope of a variable which is declared without **var** keyword is global and it may cause some confusion, so whenever declaring a variable locally or globally make sure it is declared using **var** keyword.

It is possible to have local and global variable to have same name, but the local variable will have precedence over global variable.
